## 📱 Mobile First Design

Mobile Navigation Fix
To make the navigation menu responsive on mobile without JavaScript or libraries, I used CSS media queries. The navbar switches to a horizontal, wrapped layout on screens 768px and below. Menu items display inline-block with adjusted spacing, ensuring all links fit neatly on one line or wrap smoothly. This pure CSS solution provides a simple, lightweight, and fully accessible mobile navigation experience.
